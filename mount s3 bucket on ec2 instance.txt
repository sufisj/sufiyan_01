
today task:- mount s3 bucket on ec2 instance

firstly we have to normally make an instance and s3 bucket....

then we have to log in cli and do configure aws 

then follow the given command mentioned below 
sudo su 

amazon-linux-extras install epel -y

yum install s3fs-fuse -y

echo <access key>:<secrate acess key> > ${HOME}/.andy 

chmod 600 ${HOME}/.andy 

mkdir /rocky

s3fs (bucketname) /rocky -o passwd_file=${HOME}/.andy

mount | grep rocky 

cd /rocky

touch file {1..10}

If you check the peritcular bucket in aws account the file would get upload if you delete from s3 bucket so it would delete either from cli..
